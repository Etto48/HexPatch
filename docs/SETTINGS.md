# Settings

Settings are stored inside `settings.json`. This file is located in the config folder of HexPatch.
The config folder is located in the following locations:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\HexPatch`
- Linux: `$HOME/.config/HexPatch` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/HexPatch`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/HexPatch`

You can specify a different configuration file to use with the `--config` flag.

If the file or directory doesn't exist, it will be created with the default settings.

To improve forward compatibility, the app will not create a file with the default settings if the `--config` flag is not used. This is to avoid creating a config file that will override new default settings in future versions of the app.

Settings are stored in JSON format and have the following structure:

```json
{
    "color": {
        //color settings, used to define the style of the UI
    },
    "key": {
        //key settings, used to define the keybindings
    },
    "app": {
        //app settings, used to define the behavior of the app
    },
    "custom": {
        //custom settings, used to define plugin related settings in a Key-Value format
    }
}
```

If a setting is not present in the file, the default value will be used.
For `color` settings, the default value changes based on the theme specified in the `app` settings, if the theme is not specified, the default theme is `"auto"` and if the detection fails, the `"dark"` theme is used.

You can find the default settings [here](https://github.com/Etto48/hexpatch/blob/master/test/default_settings.json).
You can also generate the same file by running `hexpatch --config <CONFIG_PATH>` passing in a path that doesn't exist yet, the file will be created there.
